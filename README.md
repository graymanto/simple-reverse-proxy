# Simple Reverse Proxy

A simple reverse proxy written in golang, with support for http basic authentication, ssl and lets encrypt.

This can be used to add ssl and basic authentication to an unsecured web service with minimal setup.

## Build

```bash
go get
go build -o simple-rp
```

## Run

To start the reverse proxy, simply run the executable generated by the build.

```
./simple-rp -destHost www.myserver.com -destPort 8080
```

The following flags are available

* listenPort - the port the server will bind to (default 443)
* destPort - the port of the server being reverse proxied
* destHost - the host being reverse proxied
* destScheme - the scheme of the server being reverse proxied (default http)
* scheme - specifies whether to use http or https (default https). 
* letsEncrypt - specifies if a lets encrypt certificate should be automatically generated (default false)
* sslHostName - if letsEncrypt is true, this is the hostname for the lets encrypt whitelist
* user - the user name to be used for the basic authentication (default user)
* password - the password to be used for the basic authentication (default password)
* certFile - if letsEncrypt is false, but https is being used, specifies the ssl cert file
* keyFile - if letsEncrypt is false, but https is being used, specifies the ssl cert file
